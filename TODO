* Integration for writing other Hadoop classes

** Input formats
** Output formats
** (Raw)Comparators
** Writables (?)
** Other things?

* Logging

- Splits being processed by individual tasks
- Probably other logging?

* Use class loader instead of pools

The current implementation builds small statically-compiled pools of
var-trampolining implementations of the various Hadoop classes which Hadoop
expects to locate via name-based reflection.  A more general implementation
would use a custom ClassLoader which could dynamically generate and return new
instances of the supported types.
