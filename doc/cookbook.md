# Uncookedbook

These are things parkour can do, and needs some examples for:

  - Multiple reducer outputs.
  - Multiple mappers consuming multiple inputs.
  - Group by E2LD for reduction, using a side-data ETLD list.
  - Re-usable distributed counting and generation of unique indices as
    for a matrix.  Support arbitrary types being counted and indexed.
